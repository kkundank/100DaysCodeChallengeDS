Time complexity basics lies in loop variables increment and decrement.

Linear Search - O(n) --> incremented/decremented by constant.

Binary Search - O(nlogn) --> Loop variables is divided multiplied by a constant.

Selection Sort - O(n^2) -->  number of times the innermost statement is executed.

Insertion Sort - O(n^2) --> 

O(loglogn) --> loop variables is reduced / increased exponentially by a constant amount.
